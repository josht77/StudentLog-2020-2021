ran into trouble with the script. However we figured most of it out. I still am having trouble with what I put int he terminal to run the script because I have to copy and paste the whole script in the terminal in order for it to run properly.

YES! Now my script works properly when I run the command bash scripts/start-entry.sh . It makes it much easier to do my logs now. I am signing off now.
